# web3_dapp

* Run the development console

    ```
    truffle develop
    ```

* Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with truffle.

    ```
    compile
    migrate
    ```

* In the client directory, we run the React app. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.

    ```
    cd client
    npm run start
    ```

* Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.

    ```
    // inside the development console.
    test

    // outside the development console..
    truffle test
    ```

* Jest is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.

    ```
    // ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
    npm run test
    ```

* To build the application for production, use the build script. A production build will be in the client/build folder.

    ```
    // ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
    npm run build
    ```
